will hadoop try to generate the lost replicates on the other alive nodes? or just do nothing(since still have 2 replicas left).

Yes, Hadoop will recognize it and make copies of that data on some other nodes. When Namenode stop receiving heart beats from 
the data nodes, it assumes that data node is lost. To keep the replication of the all the data to defined replication factor, 
it will make the copies on other data nodes.

Add, what if the down data node come back after a while, can hadoop recognize the data on that node?
Yes, when a data node comes back with all its data, Name node will remove/delete the extra copies of data. In the next heart 
beat to the data node, Name node will send the instruction to remove the extra data and free up the space on disk.
