HDFS : It is a distributed file system that is well suited for the storage of large files. 
It's documentation states that it is not, however, a general purpose file system, and does not provide fast 
individual record lookups in files. 

HBase: on the other hand, is built on top of HDFS and provides fast record lookups  updates for large tables. 
This can sometimes be a point of conceptual confusion. HBase internally puts your data in indexed "StoreFiles" 
that exist on HDFS for high-speed lookups

HDFS is just a file system.HBase is now built on top of hdfs, you could compare 
this relationship to mysql/.... and .... database(hbase) vs filesystem(hdfs)
