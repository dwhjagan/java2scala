The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is designed to store very large data sets
reliably, and to stream those data sets at high bandwidth to user applications.
In a large cluster, thousands of servers both host directly attached storage and
execute user application tasks.

Features of HDFS
It is suitable for the distributed storage and processing.
Hadoop provides a command interface to interact with HDFS.
The built-in servers of namenode and datanode help users to easily check the status of cluster.
Streaming access to file system data.
HDFS provides file permissions and authentication.
