It works like this..Puppet agent is a daemon that runs on all the client servers
(the servers where you require some configuration, or the servers which are going to be managed using puppet.)

All the clients which are to be managed will have puppet agent installed on them, and are called nodes in puppet.

Puppet Master: This machine contains all the configuration for different hosts. 
Puppet master will run as a daemon on this master server.

Puppet Agent: This is the daemon that will run on all the servers, which are to be managed using puppet. 
Puppet agent will go and ask the configuration for itself from the puppet master server at a specific time interval.

The connection between puppet agent and master is made in a secure encrypted channel with the help of SSL.

If suppose the puppet agent has already applied the required configuration and there are no new changes then 
it will do nothing.
