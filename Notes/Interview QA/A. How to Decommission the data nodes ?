Steps for Decommissioning:

1) Before add any property, stop your cluster. Otherwise, it will affect your cluster. 
You can do this using the command stop-dfs.sh

Next, Go to your Resource Manager node to edit yarn-site.xml

2) You need to add this property in your yarn-site.xml

<property>
   <name>yarn.resourcemanager.node.exclude-path</name>
   <value>/home/hadoop/excludes</value>
</property>

Note- In value section, mention your excludes file address.

Now, go to your master node (Namenode) and edit the hdfs-site.xml file-

3) Add this property to hdfs-site.xml

<property>
   <name>dfs.hosts.exclude</name>
   <value>/home/hadoop/excludes</value>
</property>

Note–If the Resource Manager and the Namenode (Master Node) are on the same machine, then simply edit the yarn-site.xml  
and hdfs-site.xml of Namenode (Master node)

4) Next, start your cluster using the following commands:

Note–If the Resource Manager and the Namenode (Master Node) are on the same machine, then simply edit the yarn-site.xml
and hdfs-site.xml of Namenode (Master node)

start-dfs.sh     #(Run this command On Masternode/Namenode only)
start-yarn.sh    #(Run this command On Resource Manager)

Note- If the Resource Manager (Nodemanager) and Namenode are running on the same machine, 
then run the above commands on Namenode (Master Node) only.

5) We need to update exclude file on both machine Resource manager and Namenode (Master Node), if it’s not there 
then we can create an exclude file on both the machine

vi excludes

Add the Datanode/Slave-node address, for decommissioning-

192.168.10.103 ( example include actual Ip address )

6) Run the following command in the Resource Manager:

yarn rmadmin -refreshNodes     (on Resource Manager)

This command will basically check the yarn-site.xml and process that property.
and decommission the mentioned node from yarn. It means now yarn manager will not give any job to this node.

7) Run the following command on the Namenode to check hdfs-site.xml and process the property and decommissioned
the specified node/datanode.

hdfs dfsadmin -refreshNodes           (on Namenode )
This command will basically check the yarn-site.xml and process that property, and Decommission the mentioned node
from YARN. Meaning, the YARN Manager will not give any job to this node.

-- Refresh Node successful.

8) Run the command hadoop dfsadmin –report
hadoop dfsadmin -report
