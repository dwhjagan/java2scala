Though both Iterator and Enumeration allows you to traverse over elements of
Collections in Java, there is some significant difference between them
e.g. Iterator also allows you to remove elements from collection during traversal
but Enumeration doesn't allow that, it doesn't got the remove() method.
Enumeration is also a legacy class and not all Collection supports it e.g.
Vector supports Enumeration but ArrayList doesn't. On the other hand Iterator
is the standard class for iteration and traversal. By the way,
what is difference between Enumeration and Iterator in Java?

--- Enumeration
hasMoreElement()
nextElement()
N/A

---- Iterator
hasNext()
next()
remove()

-- The word "traverse" means "to go or travel across or over"

A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
It models the mathematical set abstraction.

The Set
This extends Collection to handle sets, which must contain unique elements.

1	add( )  Adds an object to the collection.

2	clear( ) Removes all objects from the collection.

3	contains( ) Returns true if a specified object is an element within the collection.

4	isEmpty( ) Returns true if the collection has no elements.

5	iterator( ) Returns an Iterator object for the collection, which may be used to retrieve an object.

6	remove( ) Removes a specified object from the collection.

7	size( ) Returns the number of elements in the collection.
